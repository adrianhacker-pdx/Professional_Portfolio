# Documentation Experience and Examples

## Hewlett-Packard - New Product Research and Development

Project Notes:  I worked as a project coordinator at Hewlett-Packard in the Quality and Reliability Engineering department.  My overall role was to track all aspects of engineer testing and data collect for certain parts of a high volume photo copier. I designed training programs and documentation for the assembly line workers.  I wrote self-serve SQL databases that housed and reported massive amounts of wierd data in meaningful ways. I assisted engineers in developing various tests that measured how well a photo copier could withstand varying extreme and weird conditions.  Think humidity, cold, hot, slanted surfaces, weird paper weights, and so on. 

## Intel Corporation - Factory Work Instructions and Manufacturing Defect Excursion Response

## Ethhub.io - Three Freelance Web3 Educational Articles

**Ethhub.io: Stateless Clients**

**Ethhub.io: ZK Rollups**

**Ethhub.io: Ethereum Account Abstraction**

Project Notes: December 3, 2023 - A link check indicates that Ethhub.io has been deprecated, along with access to the actual articles. I authored three articles for the site, the titles of which are listed below. These articles were among my first freelance pieces on blockchain topics. At the time, I had no prior knowledge of these subjects, but due to financial necessity, I took on the challenge. I discovered these writing bounties on Gitcoin, conducted swift and thorough research, and produced concise, informative, non-technical articles. These were ultimately accepted by the bounty issuer and included in Ethhub.io's documentation.

## Vyper Smart Contract Programming Language Documentation - Compiler Exceptions

[Vyper Smart Contract Programming Language Documentation:  Compiler Exceptions with Examples](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compiler-exceptions.html)

Project Notes: This project involved a bounty from Gitcoin. At the time, I was financially constrained and needed to produce a high-quality document to receive payment. While I possess considerable knowledge in software engineering, my experience, especially in smart contracts, was limited. I experimented in the Vyper IDE by inputting random code, hypothesizing that this would trigger a wide range of compiler exceptions in the debugging log. My assumption proved accurate. In my initial draft, I included examples that I believed correctly demonstrated the errors. Subsequently, I consulted a Vyper Engineer, who kindly reviewed my work. Whenever he identified inaccuracies in my examples, he provided the correct error models, which I then used to update the document. This task stands out as one of my greatest achievements in gathering information and synthesizing a solution for a complex, unfamiliar technical problem. By seeking assistance when necessary, I was able to produce outstanding results, which are still visible in the documentation.

## Livepeer Android Studio APK Creation and Pushing to Google Play - Repository Instructions and Documentation

[Added the Documentation for Generating an Android APK](https://github.com/adrianhacker-pdx/android)

Project Notes: During this project, I had no prior experience in Android app development or APK creation and publishing. Utilizing Android Studio and its accompanying documentation, I developed and deployed an APK for an Android Livepeer server. Throughout the process, I meticulously documented each step by hand and sought assistance from the principal developer when necessary. After successfully generating and publishing the APK, I created the documentation found in the linked repository above. Both the screenshots and the written content are my original work.

## Ethereum EVM Educational Article Series - Two Parts

[A Deep Dive into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - Part 3: Execution Model of the EVM](https://kauri.io/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm/ded63988153147348d7c9617b09135af/a)

[A Deep Dive into the Ethereum Virtual Machine - Part 4: The EVM and High-Level Programming Languages](https://kauri.io/#collections/A%20Deep%20Dive%20Into%20The%20Ethereum%20Virtual%20Machine%20(EVM)%20Series/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-par/)

Project Notes: The two articles mentioned above were initially abandoned Gitcoin bounties, which I completed. When I undertook these projects, my understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was minimal. However, I conducted extensive research on the EVM, rapidly assimilating the essential facts needed to write these in-depth explorations. These articles were designed for an audience with limited technical knowledge and non-professional background. Eventually, the bounties were accepted and incorporated into Kauri.io, a website dedicated to blockchain education.

## MakerDAO Governance Reporting and Documentation

[MakerDAO weekly Governance news:  MKR holder DAI-gest](https://github.com/adrianhacker-pdx/MKR-holder-DAI-gest)

Project Notes: After completing several moderately complex projects in the Web3 domain, I began exploring Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). My interest in MakerDAO was piqued primarily because bounties on Gitcoin were often paid in Dai, which sparked my curiosity. Delving deeper, I discovered an opportunity in the community forums: an open call for a contributor to compile and distill weekly governance news for dissemination across various online platforms. The task was both fundamental and crucial for a DAO, focusing on the accuracy and accessibility of DAO-related information. I proposed the "Maker DAI-gest" (a little pun intended) and spent nearly five months as a paid contributor in the MakerDAO governance community. Ultimately, I left the project to return to land-based employment.
