Welcome to my hybrid GitHub coverletter/portfolio for the **Validator Engagement Specialist** position at Polygon Labs. This repository, with its structured content, media, and work samples, showcases my skills and enthusiasm for joining Polygon Labs. I will individually address each job requirement, detailing my relevant experience and capability to deliver exceptional results. </p>

<h3>Clean Up and Expand Official Validator Documentation</h3>

<p>Germany may have found a word that expresses the joy of driving (Fahrvergn√ºgen), but I have one that expresses the thrill and awe of great documentation:

__Dokumentationsnervenkitzelehrfurcht__   

The docs are where a project will live or die. You have nothing if a user is not able to learn your product. DOCUMENTATION IS THE KEY TO THE KINGDOM. 100% adherence to a style guide is essential. With a fine tooth comb I will ensure the Validator Documentation is above reproach with formatting and style guides.</p>

 My portfolio [work examples](https://github.com/adrianhacker-pdx/android) include step by step instructions I have created in past projects. I can use words precisely to craft simple and effective docs. Little jokes here and there or an original narrative tone encourage readers to read the instructions. I am aware of the fact that at the root of this role one of the major duties is to make sure people want to read the instructions.

<h3>Create narrative-driven tutorials/educational walk-through content:</h3>
<p>Well written docs take the user on a logical start to finish experience answering 'when', 'where','how', and 'why' steps in a procedure execute.  When a task is broken into it's smallest possible components, anyone can follow it. A good tutorial can take any individual through the steps they read to a successful completion on every attempt.</p>

<h3>Monitor/support Discord and other social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc) for validator and infrastructure-specific questions:</h3>

<p>I have been using my personal life as the high stakes training ground for the day my social media reign would reach the tech sector.  Rest assured that I am fully versed in all of the social media platforms. I transform instantly into one of the rich cool kids doing rich cool things.</p>

<h3>Identify pain points for validators and alleviate them through better content and community knowledge-building.  Act as primary POC to ensure all Technical queries for Validator are solved:</h3>
<h3>Use community needs and feedback to help drive feature roadmap for validator client software:</h3>
<p>I am hearing CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT & WORLD CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE. Any documentation or training system under my charge will have feedback opportunities everywhere.  I want a user to barely have to lift a finger to suggest improvements. Amazing ideas can come from anywhere at any time and there has to be plenty of nets to catch them. I have used Github's project management kanban system in the past. My previous experience and companies have made accountability, discpline, and open communcation lines second nature. I value 100% transparancy to my manager and team mates regarding my work load and priorities. It is important to me for my manager to be able to look at the current task I am performing and generally know why that's what I doing when I'm doing it. 
<p>Under my charge, I will develop a self-serve customer support hero platform. A support forum that brings together the best aspects of hand-holding and concierge service and DIY. We design a formula with many cues that are repeated to help users identify where they are in a support instrument and how to get to other support instruments.
<h3>Experience with Linux systems & Very comfortable using command-line tools and utilities:</h3>
<p>I use the Linux command line every single day. This repository was created using Git on the command line.</p>
<h3>Ability to organise self and others:</h3>
<p>I have worked remotely as a tier 2 customer service agent in the past. I am an excellent self starter. My deliverables are consistent and on time. I am proactive about overcoming barriers that jeapordize any of that.</p>
<h3>Strong communication skills, oral and written:</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3>Ability to decipher technical data and explain it in plain English:</h3>
<p>Information locating and translation to non-technical audiences is a core skill of the electronics technology degree program that I have completed. Learning how to locate data sheets for components is essential. I have developed knowledge of where certain info likely exists, and the real key to info locating is that the squeeky wheel gets oiled. A polite but effective combination of urgency and annoyingness can unlock the secrets of the universe.<p>
<h3>Can prioritise workload and execute tasks accordingly and in line with industry best practices:</h3>
I am a hard worker and hit the ground running, even in new settings. I am a careful observer and ask questions easily for clarity.  I desire and work to be a contributor within my work group that people can count on.  I never want to be 'that guy.' Ew. No.
<h3>Knowledge of DevOps/system administration/network infrastructure is a plus:</h3>
<p>System administration and network infrastructure are subject matters that I have learned in college.  Anything that I am unsure about or need to know more about I fully intend on finding a friendly developer or two who I can ask questions. Info locating is an art as much as it is a skill.</p>
